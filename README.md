# SchemeInterpreter

Full-fledged interpeter for the Scheme/Lisp language written in Python. Tail-recursive optimized and supports local and dynamically scoped procedures. Follows the standard REPL Read-Evaluate-Print Loop when evaluating expressions.

To run:
 
Download, navigate to the correct folder, then run the following command from your terminal
`python3 scheme.py` or `python scheme.py` depending on which version of python you have.

The interpreter should then appear in the same terminal window, and ready to evaluate scheme commands.
